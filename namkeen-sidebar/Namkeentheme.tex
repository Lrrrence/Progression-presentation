%\begin{block}{Why the Namkeen beamer theme?}
\begin{columns}
  \begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Nozzle guide vanes are operated at extremely high temperatures ($\sim$1500Â°C).
      \item Online monitoring is difficult to achieve.
      \item Currently used methods require optical access. 
      \item Acoustic methods offer a potential alternative.
    \end{itemize}

 % \begin{itemize}
   % \item<1-> In October 2020, I had to give a presentation at an International Conference.
  %  \item<2-> Since there was no NUST School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (NUST-SEECS) branded beamer theme, I tried to create the Namkeen beamer theme.
  %  \item<3-> This theme is based on the open source AAU sidebar theme so that other researchers and students at NUST could use the theme for their presentations.

\begin{itemize}
  \item The temperature sensitivity of the $S_0$ mode has been verified experimentally by measuring a change in group velocity with temperature.
  \item Wedge transducers in a pitch-catch configuration are used to excite a 1~mm thick aluminium plate at 1 MHz-mm, using a 10--cycle sine pulse. 
  \item Time of flight is measured using cross-correlation.
  \item Group velocity is calculated using the distance between transducers.

        \item The temperature sensitivity of the system is 1.26--1.78~m~s$^{-1}$\si{\degreeCelsius}$^{-1}$ over the range 24\si{\degreeCelsius}--94\si{\degreeCelsius}.

    \item The effect of plate holes on Lamb wave mode propagation will be investigated through simulation and experimentation.
    \item The ability to monitor temperature at a number of locations through the analysis of acoustic reflections will be explored.
    \item The effect of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) on wave propagation will be investigated using COMSOL models.
    \item COMSOL simulations will be used to investigate the use of a new transducer configuration that can operate at high temperatures, mostly likely utilising wave guides and Hertzian contact points.
    \item Depending on the outcome of the previous COMSOL study and time constraints, a waveguide system will be tested experimentally.
